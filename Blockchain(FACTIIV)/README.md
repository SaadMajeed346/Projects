## Factiiv Network Repo

Credit Reporting Agencies have huge impact on economic growth but the number of errors produced in credit reporting is astonishing, resulting in misaligned economic and legal incentives. More than one in five consumers have alleged inaccuracy in their credit file by the Report appeared in CNBC on September 27, 2017. Lenders respond to this incorrect data by offering higher interest rates, less favorable terms, or denying credit. For this, we are developing Factiiv network whose focus is on decentralized reputation in which the participants are self-sovereign entities establishing reputation. Reputation is created by or satisfaction with products/services and its inverse, attested by incentivizing participants where successful or fraudulent attestations will affect their reputations. These steps will be performed to generate credit reports which provides detailed information about credit activities of a person/organization represented by credit scores. This report helps lenders to determine how likely they will get back their loan and measuring individual’s reputation. This will provide a solution where decentralized credit reporting will be done and customers will have control over their credit and payment experiences, their identity will be pseudo-anonymous and self-sovereign. The system facilitates customers for masking personal information and only reveal required information for a specific process on their own will. With this, credit reporting agencies monopoly can be broken and here, customer’s sensitive information cannot be sold or used without their consent.
